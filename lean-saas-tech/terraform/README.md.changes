# Changes to AWS Load Balancer Controller Configuration

## Issue Fixed

The Terraform configuration was failing with the following error:

```
Error: Invalid function argument
  
  on alb_controller.tf line 14, in resource "aws_iam_policy" "aws_load_balancer_controller":
  14:   policy      = file("${path.module}/iam_policy.json")
    ├────────────────
    │ while calling file(path)
    │ path.module is "."
 
Invalid value for "path" parameter: no file exists at "./iam_policy.json"; this function works only with files that
are distributed as part of the configuration source code, so if this file will be created by a resource in this
configuration you must instead obtain this result from an attribute of that resource.
```

## Solution

The issue was caused by a timing problem in the Terraform configuration. The original code was:

1. Using a `null_resource` with a `local-exec` provisioner to download the IAM policy JSON file during the apply phase
2. Using the `file()` function to read this file during the planning phase
3. This failed because the file didn't exist when Terraform tried to read it during planning

The solution was to:

1. Remove the `null_resource` that was downloading the file
2. Embed the IAM policy JSON directly in the Terraform configuration using heredoc syntax
3. Update the `depends_on` references to remove the now-deleted `null_resource`

This approach ensures that the IAM policy is available during the planning phase without needing to download an external file.

## Benefits

- The configuration is now self-contained and doesn't rely on external file downloads
- The `terraform apply` command will now work without errors
- The solution maintains the same functionality as the original design
